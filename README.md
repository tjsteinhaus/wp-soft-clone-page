# WP Soft Clone Page

Soft cloning gives you the ability to clone your pages title, content, page meta, and page template into a new page. However, the key here is that it doesn't actually create a duplicate of your page, it dynamically swaps the data on load. By doing so you don't have to worry about updating the content in more than one place.
